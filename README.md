# Universal Turing Machine Simulator

This project simulates a Universal Turing Machine (UTM) that can take another Turing Machine (TM) and an input string `w`, and mimic the behavior of the TM. The UTM will accept or reject the string `w` based on the behavior of the TM.

## Features

- Simulates the behavior of any given Turing Machine
- Accepts or rejects input strings based on the given Turing Machine's rules
- Implements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts

## Components

### Turing Machine (TM)
- States
- Alphabet
- Transition Function
- Initial State
- Blank Symbol
- Final States

### Universal Turing Machine (UTM)
- Input Turing Machine's definition
- Input string `w`
- Simulation of the Turing Machine's behavior

## Example

An example Turing Machine is provided and tested within the program to validate the results.

## Diagrams

Clear diagrams showing the working of the UTM and its representation are included in the project.

## Data Structures

Detailed explanation of the data structures used to solve the problem is provided in the report.

## Usage

To run the simulation, execute the main program file. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
